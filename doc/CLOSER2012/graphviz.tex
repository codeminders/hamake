% parameters to \digraph:
% 1 - parameters for \includegraphics (optional; default value is "scale=1")
% 2 - name of the digraph
% 3 - body of the digraph

            The file \texttt{#2.ps} hasn't been created from
            \texttt{#2.dot} yet. \\
            Run `\texttt{dot -Tps -o #2.ps #2.dot}' to create it. \\
            Here is a \textsf{bash} loop to process all \textsf{dot} files
            in the current directory: \\
