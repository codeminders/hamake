Q: How 'hamake' is different from [http://www.cascading.org/ Cascading]

A: In short: 'Cascading' is a framework, while 'hamake' is a tool. Some differences:
  * hamake does not require any custom programming. It helps to automate running your existing Hadoop tasks and PIG scripts
  * We found hamake especially suitable for incremental processing of datasets
  * You can use 'hamake' to automate tasks written in other languages, using _Hadoop streaming_
